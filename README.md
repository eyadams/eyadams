# Erik Y. Adams Github repository

I'm a part time developer, part time data scientist, and part time librarian.
In my day job I am the Manager of Library Digital Initiatives for the law firm
of [Sidley Austin](https://www.sidley.com). I am also the co-founder of
[Golden Arrow Publishing](https://www.goldenarrownews.com), a news delivery
service. 

I’m interested in developing in Python, creating visualizations with Tableau,
and whatever I need to do to get the work done. Lately that seems to mean
a lot of PowerShell. 

I’m currently learning PowerShell. Because the world needed another scripting
language.
